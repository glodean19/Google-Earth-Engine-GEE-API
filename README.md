# Google-Earth-Engine-GEE-API

DataKind Workstream 2 - Climate Change Susceptibility Model/Analysis
Setting up and exploring Google Earth Engine to gain some hands-on experience working with geospatial data. This task is to learn how to extract data for a specific long and lat, from a Google Earth engine dataset. Check out this comprehensive guide on setting up GEE API for Python.

A typical deliverable for this task could be extracting elevation for a particular coordinate and validating it with real-world data.

IMPORTANT
Google Earth engine uses Google Cloud, therefore before to run the script, you need gcloud installed on your computer. GEE will work with connecting to your Goggle Account for authentication and it will provide you with a token to add in the code when running ee.authenticate(). Add the token in the code and press enter to get authorisation before to move to ee.initialize().
